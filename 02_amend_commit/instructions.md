Your task is to:

* Create a new file - `commitment_issues.txt`
* Copy the following text to it, save the changes and commit it.

> Here we are creating files, learning git. 

* Now, we realise we forgot to add the following line. Let's add it under the previous commit.

> And it's not that hard! :)
