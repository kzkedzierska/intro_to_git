# How to prepare
This document provides advice how to prepare yourself for this workshop, and using git in the future.

## Installation

* Linux (Debian, for example Ubuntu)

```bash
sudo apt install git-all
```

* Linux (Fedora)

```bash
sudo dnf install git-all
```

* MacOS

You can try typing below command. If you have `git` installed it should print git version, otherwise it should prompt `git` installation.

```bash
git --version
```

If that doesn't work, download `git` installer from [Git website](https://git-scm.com/download/mac)

* Windows

Download `git` installer from [Git website](https://git-scm.com/download/win). I recommended choosing the last option (_Using Git and optional Unix tools form the Windows Command Prompt_) during _Adjusting your PATH environment_ step of the installer. This will add some commands one can use from command line (git bash).
